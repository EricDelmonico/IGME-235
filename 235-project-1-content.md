# Project 1 Proposal

## 1. Game Concept

This game will be a top-down tile-based dungeon crawler game, where the player tries to navigate from one side of the dungeon to the other.

## 2. Genre

This will be an Dungeon-Crawler Adventure game.

## 3. Platform

Mainly desktop web users, however if I have enough time I would make it work well on mobile as well.

## 4. Story

The character in this game has to avoid traps and enemies in order to make it out of the dungeon alive. If there is time to implement it, there will also be a flashlight feature where visibility is limited.

## 5. Aesthetics

The graphics style will be simple pixel art with a limited color palette. There will be 8-bit sounds for taking damage and for dealing damage. The UI may also have sound if there is time to implement that.

## 6. Gameplay

The player can move in one of four directions, and the enemies only move when they do. They have to find the best way to the exit by fighting enemies and avoiding traps, or die trying.
